## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project will be called "Plantopedia" and it will be a site in which users will be able to view, learn, and share information about their favorite house plants. Each and every plant will have important information such as scientific name, care facts, and pictures for our users to view. Plantopedia users will also be able to comment and view other users comments about any specific plant species they may be interested in. Certain users on our site will have the title of admin and will have the ability to remove any users or comments that they deem necessary. Our application will be used to unite plant lovers across the world while giving them access to a vast supply of knowledge that they will learn from.
